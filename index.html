      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        This document proposes a new dictionary member for
        <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia">getDisplayMedia</a>. This new
        member allows an application to specify a preference for capturing the tab from which
        <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia">getDisplayMedia</a> was
        called.

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Currently,
        <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia">getDisplayMedia</a> does not
        allow the application to influence the user's selection of a capture source. This design
        decision is perennially debated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes the only source that makes sense is the current tab. For example, a productivity
        suite might wish to stream itself to a virtual conference. When such a site calls
        <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia">getDisplayMedia</a>, any
        selection by the user of a source other than the current tab is likely user-error, and the
        site is likely to discard the resulting {{MediaStream}} rather than use it.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is needed to support such use-cases well is an API that only offers the current tab.
        Such an API is currently in the works, and its tentative name is
        <code>getViewportMedia</code>. The main benefit of <code>getViewportMedia</code> is that it
        will offer the user a confirmation-only dialog. The drawbacks are the long time until this
        API is be standardized, implemented, and until the security mechanism it requires are widely
        adopted.
      </p>
      <p>
        We propose a simpler mechanism that can act as a stopgap measure until
        <code>getViewportMedia</code> is standardized, implemented and adopted by the Web. This
        mechanism is a dictionary member that indicates to the user agent that the application
        prefers the current tab. The user agent then still shows the user a dialog that complies
        with all of the requirements placed on
        <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia">getDisplayMedia</a>, by
        offering all possible sources to the user, but the current tab is presented as the most
        prominent option.
