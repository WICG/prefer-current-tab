      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        This document proposes a new dictionary member for
        <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia">getDisplayMedia</a>. This new
        member allows an application to specify a preference for capturing the tab from which
        <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia">getDisplayMedia</a> was
        called.

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Currently,
        <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia">getDisplayMedia</a> does not
        allow the application to influence the user's selection of a capture source. This design
        decision is perennially debated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider the case of a productivity suite that wishes to stream itself to a virtual
        conference. When such an application calls
        <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia">getDisplayMedia</a>, any
        selection by the user of a source other than the current tab is likely user-error, and the
        application is likely to discard the resulting {{MediaStream}} rather than use it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In such a case, there is only one capture-source that makes sense - the current tab. An API
        is required that only offers the current tab. Such an API is currently in the works - see
        [[mediacapture-viewport]], which introduces
        <a data-cite="mediacapture-viewport/#dom-mediadevices-getviewportmedia">getViewportMedia</a
        >. The benefit of
        <a data-cite="mediacapture-viewport/#dom-mediadevices-getviewportmedia">getViewportMedia</a>
        is that it will offer the user a confirmation-only dialog. The drawbacks are the long time
        until this API is be standardized, implemented, and until the security mechanisms it
        requires become widely adopted.
      </p>
      <p>
        We introduce a simpler mechanism that can act as a stopgap measure until
        <a data-cite="mediacapture-viewport/#dom-mediadevices-getviewportmedia">getViewportMedia</a>
        is standardized, implemented and adopted by the Web. This mechanism is a dictionary member
        that indicates to the user agent that the application prefers the current tab. The user
        agent can then choose between:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Showing the user a dialog that complies with all of the requirements placed on
          <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia">getDisplayMedia</a>,
          offering all possible sources to the user, but the current tab is presented as the most
          prominent option.
        </li>
        <li>Showing the user a dialog that only offers the option of capturing the current tab.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In either case, this API is meant to ultimately be replaced by [[mediacapture-viewport]].

      <h2>preferCurrentTab</h2>
      <pre class="idl">
        partial dictionary MediaStreamConstraints {
          boolean preferCurrentTab = false;
        };
      </pre>
      <dl data-link-for="MediaStreamConstraints" data-dfn-for="MediaStreamConstraints">

          <p>
            When {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} is called with <code>|constraints|</code> (a
            dictionary), the user agent MUST run the following steps:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              If <code>|constraints|.preferCurrentTab</code> is <code>false</code>, abort these
              steps and continue instead with the
              <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/screen-capture/#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia"
                >getDisplayMedia algorithm</a
              >.
            </li>
            <li>
              If <code>|constraints|.</code>{{DisplayMediaStreamOptions/selfBrowserSurface}} is
              {{SelfCapturePreferenceEnum/"exclude"}}, return a promise [=reject|rejected=] with a
              newly [=exception/created=] {{TypeError}}.
            </li>
            <li>
              The rest of the
              <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/screen-capture/#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia"
                >getDisplayMedia algorithm</a
              >
              should now be executed, with one change - if the algorithm's execution reaches the
              step where the user agent asks the user to choose a display surface to capture, then
              the user agent SHOULD either:
              <ol>
                <li>Present the current tab as the most prominent option.</li>
                <li>
                  Present the current tab as the only option. In this case, the user agent MUST
                  mitigate against clickjacking, for example by introducing a delay until user
                  interaction may allow the capture to start.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
