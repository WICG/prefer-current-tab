      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        This document proposes a new dictionary member for
        <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia">getDisplayMedia</a>. This new
        member allows an application to specify a preference for capturing the tab from which
        <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia">getDisplayMedia</a> was
        called.

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Currently,
        <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia">getDisplayMedia</a> does not
        allow the application to influence the user's selection of a capture source. This design
        decision is perennially debated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider the case of a productivity suite that wishes to stream itself to a virtual
        conference. When such an application calls
        <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia">getDisplayMedia</a>, any
        selection by the user of a source other than the current tab is likely user-error, and the
        application is likely to discard the resulting {{MediaStream}} rather than use it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In such a case, there is only one capture-source that makes sense - the current tab. An API
        is required that only offers the current tab. Such an API is currently in the works - see
        [[mediacapture-viewport]], which introduces
        <a data-cite="mediacapture-viewport/#dom-mediadevices-getviewportmedia">getViewportMedia</a
        >. The benefit of
        <a data-cite="mediacapture-viewport/#dom-mediadevices-getviewportmedia">getViewportMedia</a>
        is that it will offer the user a confirmation-only dialog. The drawbacks are the long time
        until this API is be standardized, implemented, and until the security mechanisms it
        requires become widely adopted.
      </p>
      <p>
        We introduce a simpler mechanism that can act as a stopgap measure until
        <a data-cite="mediacapture-viewport/#dom-mediadevices-getviewportmedia">getViewportMedia</a>
        is standardized, implemented and adopted by the Web. This mechanism is a dictionary member
        that indicates to the user agent that the application prefers the current tab. The user
        agent can then take that preference into consideration when representing the request to the
        user.
      </p>
      <p>
        In either case, this API is meant to ultimately be replaced by [[mediacapture-viewport]].

      <pre class="idl">
        partial dictionary MediaStreamConstraints {
          boolean preferCurrentTab = false;
        };

          <p>
            When {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} is called with <code>|constraints|</code> (a
            dictionary), the user agent MUST run the following steps:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              If <code>|constraints|.preferCurrentTab</code> is <code>false</code>, abort these
              steps and continue instead with the
              <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/screen-capture/#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia"
                >getDisplayMedia algorithm</a
              >.
            </li>
            <li>
              If <code>|constraints|.</code>{{DisplayMediaStreamOptions/selfBrowserSurface}} is
              {{SelfCapturePreferenceEnum/"exclude"}}, return a promise [=reject|rejected=] with a
              newly [=exception/created=] {{TypeError}}.
            </li>
            <li>
              The rest of the
              <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/screen-capture/#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia"
                >getDisplayMedia algorithm</a
              >
              should now be executed, with one change - if the algorithm's execution reaches the
              step where the user agent asks the user to choose a display surface to capture, then
              the user agent SHOULD take the applications's preference for the current tab into
              account, making it the most prominent of any option presented. User agents MAY rely on
              this preference to limit the set of options presented to the user.
            </li>

              <p>
                This carve-out is an intentional violation of [[SCREEN-CAPTURE]]'s requirement that
                "the getDisplayMedia API does not permit the use of constraints to narrow the set of
                options presented." This carve-out does not obviate user agents' duty to ensure
                active user consent, for example by mitigating against inadvertent sharing
                (clickjacking, etc.).
