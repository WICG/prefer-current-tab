# Prefer-Current-Tab
This is a proposal for extending the [getDisplayMedia](https://www.w3.org/TR/screen-capture/) API to accept a new dictionary member in [MediaStreamConstraints](https://www.w3.org/TR/mediacapture-streams/#dom-mediastreamconstraints). This dictionary member indicates to the browser that the application is interested in capturing the tab in which it itself lives.
