      <p>
        This document proposes a new dictionary member for
        <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia">getDisplayMedia</a>. This new
        member allows an application to specify a preference for capturing the tab from which
        <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia">getDisplayMedia</a> was
        called.

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Currently,
        <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia">getDisplayMedia</a> does not
        allow the application to influence the user's selection of a capture source. This design
        decision is perennially debated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider the case of a productivity suite that wishes to stream itself to a virtual
        conference. When such an application calls
        <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia">getDisplayMedia</a>, any
        selection by the user of a source other than the current tab is likely user-error, and the
        application is likely to discard the resulting {{MediaStream}} rather than use it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In such a case, there is only one capture-source that makes sense - the current tab. An API
        is required that only offers the current tab. Such an API is currently in the works, and its
        tentative name is <code>getViewportMedia</code>. The main benefit of
        <code>getViewportMedia</code> is that it will offer the user a confirmation-only dialog. The
        drawbacks are the long time until this API is be standardized, implemented, and until the
        security mechanisms it requires are widely adopted.
      </p>
      <p>
        We propose a simpler mechanism that can act as a stopgap measure until
        <code>getViewportMedia</code> is standardized, implemented and adopted by the Web. This
        mechanism is a dictionary member that indicates to the user agent that the application
        prefers the current tab. The user agent then still shows the user a dialog that complies
        with all of the requirements placed on
        <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia">getDisplayMedia</a>, by
        offering all possible sources to the user, but the current tab is presented as the most
        prominent option.

      <pre class="idl">
        partial dictionary MediaStreamConstraints {
          boolean preferCurrentTab = false;
        };
      </pre>

          <p>
            When {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} is called with <code>|constraints|</code> (a
            dictionary), the user agent MUST run the following steps:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              If <code>|constraints|.preferCurrentTab</code> is <code>false</code>, abort these
              steps and continue instead with the
              <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/screen-capture/#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia"
                >getDisplayMedia algorithm</a
              >.
            </li>
            <li>
              If <code>|constraints|.</code>{{DisplayMediaStreamOptions/selfBrowserSurface}} is
              {{SelfCapturePreferenceEnum/"exclude"}}, return a promise [=reject|rejected=] with a
              newly [=exception/created=] {{TypeError}}.
            </li>
            <li>
              All other steps associated with
              <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/screen-capture/#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia"
                >getDisplayMedia algorithm</a
              >
              should now be applied. If these steps culminate in the user agent presenting the user
              with a selection of
              <a data-cite="SCREEN-CAPTURE#dfn-display-surface">display surfaces</a>, the user agent
              SHOULD present the current tab as the most prominent option.
